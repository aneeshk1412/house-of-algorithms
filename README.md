# House of Algorithms

## Introduction

The initial aim of this repository is to collect various algorithms that I come across, and create templates for them.
The main target would be for the code to be simple to understand, and as concise as possible.
Over that, I try to explore algorithms with as optimal complexity as possible, but also include those which have lower constant factors, which would be better for practical scenarios.

## cp-algorithms

This folder contains implementations of said algorithms from a competitive coding perspective.
The goal is to make code shorter and quicker to implement in C++ with use of templates, typedefs and defines.
(*hampers readability I agree, but one must learn to read unreadable codes*)
