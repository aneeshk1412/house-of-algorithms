# House of Algorithms

## Introduction

The initial aim of this repository is to collect various algorithms that I come across, and create templates for them.
The main target would be for the code to be simple to understand, and as concise as possible.
Over that, I try to explore algorithms with as optimal complexity as possible, but also include those which have lower constant factors, which would be better for practical scenarios.
