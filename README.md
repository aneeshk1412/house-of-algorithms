# House of Algorithms

## Introduction

The initial aim of this repository is to collect various data structures, algorithms, neat tricks in a single repository.
These (pretty vague) virtues will be kept in mind as I build this:

* Make this repository as a library or package that can be imported and used as public faced APIs (e.g. in Competitive Programming Contests).
* Employ as much of clean code practices, and keep the code simple to understand and concise.
* The previous rule should make it such that it is easily revisable for Interview Purposes.
* Differentiate between practical implementations and implementations with lower complexities but inefficient implementations in practice.
